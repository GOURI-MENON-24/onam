Designing my own pookalam with code!!

Designed a traditional Pookalam pattern virtually using Python Turtle. Merging art, culture and programming!


About My Project
Concentric circles and vibrant petals.
Vibrant and colourful...

Visualizing Pookalam patterns digitally, celebrating tradition through code.



I can also draft a “one-page competition-ready version” that’s more visually appealing, with emojis, colors, and short highlights so judges immediately see your innovation.

Do you want me to make that version too?
